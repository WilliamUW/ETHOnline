### Please add a sentence or two on why you're applicable for this prize.

Mask Network enables us to allow users to link their facial hash to their Ethereum address with ease while ensuring privacy!

We are using the Universal Profile API so we are able to fetch one's Ethereum address with any one of the following: an ENS domain, a Lens handle, a Farcaster username (ends with .farcaster), a .bit domain, or a Next.ID address!
