### Please add a sentence or two on why you're applicable for this prize.
UMA plays a crucial role verifying the true ownership of wallets and their respective owner's facial hashes through the optimistic oracle. Reputable relies on the oracle to report any malpractice (e.g. someone else signed up to FaceLink with your wallet and their image or they used your image for their wallet).
